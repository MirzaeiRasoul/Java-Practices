# Java-Practices

This repo created for implement java practices.

## Examples:
* Multiple Inheritance: [Java and Multiple Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-and-multiple-inheritance/)
* Interface Default Method: [Interface Default Methods in Java 8](https://dzone.com/articles/interface-default-methods-java/)
* Interface Static Method
* Interface Default Method vs. Interface Static Method
* Abstract Class vs Java 8 Interface

## Abstract Class vs Java 8 Interface
After having default and static methods inside the interface, we think about the need of abstract class in Java. An interface and an abstract class is almost similar except that you can create constructor in the abstract class whereas you can't do this in interface.
